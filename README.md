# Final Project

## Topic and Data selected
* **Selected Topic:** Craft Beer
* **Reason for Selected topic:** This topic was one that all the members of the group had familiarity and interest in
* **Description of the source data:** This Dataset contains two CSVs pertaining to beer types and breweries:
  * Beers CSV file: Contains data specific to each craft beer (alcohol content, name, type etc..)
  * Breweries CSV file: Contains data specific to each Brewery (brewery name, state located in, city located in). Can be merged with beers.csv on 'brewery_id'.
* **Questions we hope to answer with data:** Can we use machine learning to predict the type of alcohol based on features of the beer.




## Communication Protocols

Our team communicated across various platforms to plan, discuss and execute the project objectives. The three primary communication tools were Slack, Text and Zoom:
* **Slack:** We created a Slack group as a repository for links, git commands, project instructions and other resources
* **Text:** We used text as a means to discuss ideas, organize meeting times and make decisions.
* **Zoom:** We used Zoom during class times to work on issues (virtually) face to face, together in real time.
