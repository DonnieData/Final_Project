# Final Project

## Communication Protocols

Our team communicated across various platforms to plan, discuss and execute the project objectives. The three primary communication tools were Slack, Text and Zoom:
* Slack: We created a Slack group as a repository for links, git commands, project instructions and other resources
* Text: We used text as a means to discuss ideas, organize meeting times and make decisions.
* Zoom: We used Zoom during class times to work on issues (virtually) face to face, together in real time.
