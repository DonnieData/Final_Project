## Topic and Data selected
* **Selected Topic:** Craft Beer
* **Reason for Selected topic:** This topic was one that all the members of the group had familiarity and interest in
* **Description of the source data:** This Dataset contains two CSVs pertaining to beer types and breweries:
  * Beers CSV file: Contains data specific to each craft beer (alcohol content, name, type etc..)
  * Breweries CSV file: Contains data specific to each Brewery (brewery name, state located in, city located in). Can be merged with beers.csv on 'brewery_id'.
* **Questions we hope to answer with data:** Can we use machine learning to predict the type of alcohol based on features of the beer.
